= !BioHackathon 2009 hack and satellites =

We will have parallel sessions mainly focused on:

 * Software development (hack, hack, hack)
 * Use case driven hands-on seminar (try and record)

and ad-hoc satellite meetings to accelerate collaboration between the above two groups:

 * Use SatelliteTemplate to create your own satellite meeting
  * Result section of this template is expected to be cited to the meeting report

 * Use SatelliteSlots to reserve a slot for your satellite meeting
