The perl/mysql implementation of the eeDB API-toolkit can manipulate billions of short-read data and 100s of microarray expression experiment datasets (each with 10000s of probes) for our internal research purposes and is proving to scale very well. eeDB works with node and network, sequence tag, mapping, and expression data at the level of billions of elements very easily.&nbsp; Queries can access individual objects, edges, and work with streams or sets of objects queried by regions, node, or networks. </del> </td>

Several technologies were mentioned, including [http://www.ogsadai.org.uk/ OGSADAI] which is a grid-based solution where you can setup several databases that then can be queried as one. Other technologies like the cloud might also provide part of a solution. [http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ Amazon S3] and [http://www.google.com/base/ GoogleBase] allow for storing very large amounts of data (large numbers of large objects) and are relatively cheap. The upload to these systems is however very slow which must be taken into account. In addition, these services are commercial and it might be dangerous to store non-public data there. A possible solution mentioned involves creating an encrypted data image to be uploaded instead of the original dataset. Another issue is that these companies might in the future decide to increase their prices or even stop their activities. Using the cloud for data storage therefore means that you still need a local backup in case this happens.</span> </td>
