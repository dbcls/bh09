== Topics ==

Several examples of the biological data are provided by users.
The service developers explained how to use their programs for the data.
Finally, users described the several potential work-flows for the computational part of their research.

=== Data for testing ===

 * SNPs data contain 262,338 SNPs (Stroke patient vs. normal) from Affymetrix SNP Chip (provided by Prof.Kim)
 * Amino acid sequences of 53 genes (multifasta format) which are located at disease map locus of one form of epilepsy (provided by Vachiranee)
 * Nucleotide sequences (multifasta format) (provided by Riu)
 * Genome data (provided by Takeshi)


=== Softwares ===

 * BioMart
 * Galaxy
 * jORCA
 * ANNOTATOR

== Meeting log ==
  
=== Genome data ===

Question
- Takeshi asked about how to annotate in-house data by comparing with public genome data using BioMart.
- For example, how to annotate Halocynthia roretzi or Molgula tectiformis ESTs comparing with Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savigni using BioMart.
Answer
- Convert Halocynthia data into BioMart format. Install BioMart server locally. Then merge public DB and local data together.
- BioMart format is simple.


Takeshi presented an example
- minor animal (ex, H.roretzi, closest animal of Ciona)
- how can analyze Halocynthia roretzi and M.tectiformis which are rare annotation.
- type of data is ESTs, assembled EST cluster,,,etc,,
- potential flow: BioMart -> ANNOTATOR -> TogoDB


=== SNPs data ===

ANNOTATOR currently can not analyse SNPs data itself but can analyze genes data which contain SNPs of interested. [[BR]]
Galaxy (http://galaxyproject.org) and RGenetics (http://rgenetics.org/)
        quality control, ancestry, case-control analysis, tdt, oter statistical tests[[BR]]
-can link dbSNPs to Galaxy for further analysis


=== Multifasta format (amino acid sequences) ===

ANNOTATOR can upload multifasta format of amino acid sequences and do Prim-seq-an algorithm[[BR]] 
BioMart can upload GeneID but not the sequences to retrieve information associated to the GeneID[[BR]]
jORCA provide list of analysis tools which could do with FASTA format[[BR]]


=== Multifasta format (nucleotide sequences) ===

Currently, ANNOTATOR cannot analyze nucleotide sequences.

DL ESTs of Halocynthia roretzi from NCBI/Taxonomy

TogoDB by Toshiaki
- upload table format  (table services for uploading data will be able to access using WS)

=== Other comments from Developper side ===

jORCA by Oswaldo

-mapped WABI services
- jORCA: WABI WSDL application can run in local machine after installation
- jORCA can tell which kind of analysis tools can do with our multifasta format file or anykind of format. For example, using Magallanes: INB*,
if put "FASTA" in Find box, the result come up with 23 tools that could use for analysis. For analysis use myexperiment.org [[BR]]
*Magallanes: INB (Services that discover what kind of analysis can provide for your data format)

== Results ==

[[Image(bh2009-usecase_2.pdf)]]

== TODOs ==

 * How to combine the in house data into Public BioMart? => KAAS, blast2GO etc.
 * How easy to install the BioMart in local?
 * How modify the design of the interface of TogoDB?
 * User didn't have their own Data Repository site. (for TogoDB)

=== Requests from users to developper ===

==== TO: [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact IntAct], Cytoscape ====
It would be nice if user can retrieve PPIs which are expressed in any tissues by using option function. (From: Vachiranee)[[BR]]

   * At this moment the only way that Bruno@!IntAct knows of doing this is to get the list of proteins from a specific tissue (using [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride PRIDE]) and then using the list of proteins accessions to find PPIs in the molecular interaction databases, such as [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact IntAct]. If there is interest, we (!IntAct) could find a way to include this option in a future release.

==== TO: ANNOTATOR ====

 * In the conversation with mostly biology-oriented participants of the Hackathon, we found the following requests for ANNOTATOR to suit their needs


   * Ability to do batch jobs, i.e. large number of proteins annotated by our software (request came from many)[[BR]]
   * ANNOTATOR should be downloadable and deployable somewhere local[[BR]]
   * We were offered a potential collaboration in terms of using computing power of a TITECH [http://www.gsic.titech.ac.jp/index.html.en TSUBAME] supercomputer. This means the ANNOTATOR's jobs need a mechanism to be submitted to an external site.[[BR]]
   * For better results, consistency and the ability to replicate the annotator pipeline in a remote location, we need periodic and automatic updation of the underlying databases of the algorithms.[[BR]]
   * How differences between ANNOTATOR and [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/ InterProscan][[BR]]
   * Ability to save results of analysis as xml format for further analysis[[BR]]

==== TO: Galaxy ====
 * I'd like to input the list of ID on galaxy (such as Gene ID, IPR No.) to text form of biomart filter.
