= Satellite meeting for Galaxy =

== Topics ==

Galaxy is an interactive platform to process biological data using various tools.

The URL of Galaxy is: http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/

This meeting provides an opportunity to discuss the following topics on Galaxy. 

 * Internationalization (i18n):  UTF-8 encoding support, etc.
 * Workflow:  Future plan, accessibility to workflows through API, etc.
 * Authentification: remote_user login: OpenID support, email address management etc.
 * TogoDB/Galaxy companion: To browse, search and share a Galaxy history item on TogoDB.
 * Galaxy/gbrowse: two way communication

# Please add a new topic to this list.

== Notes ==
 * How to join developing Galaxy (Japanese)
   * http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kozo-ni/20090317#1237263807

 * TogoTV
   * 統合TV - galaxy1en http://togotv.dbcls.jp/movie/090312galaxy1en_f.html
      * Most of wet biologists cannot make full use of computational services, so it is effective to provide screencasts of a tool usage as well as documents
      * Currently, togoTV has over 150 movies and 250~300 accesses/day (only togoTV main site)
      * the movies are played about 200 times/day in togoTV and some movie servers (e.g. Youtube) although most of contents described in Japanese.
      * The most popular content is Primer3 tutorial, it played 4000 times since its release

 * Galaxy Screencast
   * http://galaxy.psu.edu/screencasts.html

 * Biobookmarklet - KazusaWiki (ja)
   * http://wiki.kazusa.or.jp/Biobookmarklet

 * List up i18n-ed scientific application
   * gbrowse (web)
   * CiteULike (web)
   * ... 


== Results ==
 * i18n
   * Two reasons
     * To extend end-users with dislaying native language translation of texual messages (using gettext and babel) 
     * To display non-ascii charactors (article author names, gene names, ...)
   * Create a repository http://bitbucket.org/mn3/galaxy-central-i18n/ from the galaxy repository to share the gettext message files and patches
     * Merged. http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/changeset/dc62ee52012e/
     * Known issues 
       * Static files, cheeter (.tmpl) templates
       * GetText Messages for Tools
       * Use URL lang parameter (lang=en)
       * Use Accept-Language HTTP request header (HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE)
       * Use pybabel with mako.ext.babelplugin:extract
   * Set UTF-8 to display non-ascii characters at the history and middle pane.

 * Workflow
   * Introduced the tools developed by DBCLS. http://testgalaxy.lifesciencedb.jp
     * TogoWS tool
     * Search tool of MEDLINE related PNE articles that are written by Japanese
     * Bookmakrlet tool, to display a protein 3D view of an PDB ID in a galaxy history data. Such function can be replaced by the semantic column function in future. 
   * RSS feed for a workflow to know the result updated. (c.f PubMed article alert)
   * Added View, analyze, workflow and libraries on http://test.g2.bx.psu.edu
   * Web based tool manage system / central tool repository ?
 
 * Authentification
   * Introduced the OpenID Galaxy at http://testgalaxy.lifesciencedb.jp.
     * [http://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/issue/14/openid-authentication-support galaxy / galaxy-central / issues / OpenID authentication support — bitbucket.org]
   * Known issues
     * login email address management.
 
 * Galaxy/TogoDB
   * In terms of data lifetime, TogoDB and Galaxy are complementary. (and also BioMart)
     * TogoDB is feasible for long lifetime data (dataset, reusable solid data, ...)
     * Galaxy is feasible for short lifetime data (no name data, temporal results, ... )
   * Two way communication (Import data from TogoDB, send data to TogoDB)
     * Import data from TogoDB
     * Send data into TogoDB [todo]

 * Galaxy/gbrowse 
   * Two way communication (Import data from wormbase, send data to wormbase)


== TODOs ==
 * [nakao] Provide  a workflow scenario to use the TogoDB/Galaxy companion. 
 * [atsuko] present a workflow that we want to use through RSS feed.
 * Send data into TogoDB [todo]
